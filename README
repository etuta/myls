For now, our code can do the basic ls commands: displaying the files in the current
directory and ls -l, -a, -la, -al.
We are working on trying to find a way to store the names of all the directories
in an array and calling it one by one, along with the options -l, -a, -la, -al
(if they are used). Currently, we have some incomplete code commented out that we
are working on.
